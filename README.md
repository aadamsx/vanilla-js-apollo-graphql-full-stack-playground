# vanilla-js-apollo-graphql-full-stack-playground

Play with the Apollo GraphQL client and server, without being distracted by databases, frameworks, or transpilers.

This is for GraphQL n00bs like me. I just wanted to play with GraphQL itself before I learned how to wire it up with databases or UIs. There are only two very small files, `server.js` and `client.js`.

To try it out:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/farskipper/vanilla-js-apollo-graphql-full-stack-playground.git
$ cd vanilla-js-apollo-graphql-full-stack-playground/

$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Open your browser to the url, and inspect the javascript console.

This should be a good starting point. Now you can gradually add and try out more GraphQL features.

Have fun!
